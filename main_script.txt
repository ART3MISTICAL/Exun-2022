centresw around 17 yr old Anubis, who is tasked with setting Amglena free after he receivers a
message from the saint within a dream.
First Choice:
Anubis wakes up from a dream and recounts the prophecy he received in his dream: He is meant to
find Maglena and set him free from a place named Armageddon that he doesn’t know the location

He is offered two choices: Look for Armageddon in the Ihleda national library maps
Ask his father (the president of Ilheda) about Armageddon
If choice two is chosen, The father will refuse to tell Anubis the location and ground him… the player
will be returned back to the choices.
Choice 1 onwards: Once in the library, Anubis finally finds an ancient scripture that shows that
